# Deploying

The default Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructural resources are managed with
[Terraform](../../terraform/README.md),
which can be automated via a
[Github Actions workflow](../../.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

There are some manual steps that we must complete **in order**
prior to running Terraform,
and some that are necessary after the applications are up and running.

## Table of Contents

1. [Create a new GCP project](./01-gcp-project-setup/README.md)
2. [Register custom domains](./02-dns-registration/README.md)
3. [Configure Firebase](./03-firebase-configuration/README.md)
4. [Assign Github Secrets](./04-github-secrets/README.md)
5. [Finalize the Github workflow](./05-github-workflow/README.md)
6. [Post-deploy steps](./06-post-deploy-steps/README.md)

## Restrictions

### Each storefront environment **requires its own GCP project**

While it would be possible to deploy multiple sets of
Terraform-managed services to a single project, we can
only configure a single Firebase instance per GCP project,
meaning each environment would then share a user pool.

Using multiple GCP projects ensures that each environment
has its own user pool.

### Custom **(sub)domains are necessary** for the Cloud Run services

While Cloud Run gives us autogenerated URLs by default,
we cannot pass those as environment variables to other Cloud Run
services using Terraform because:

- They need to be known _before_ a service is configured
- CMS needs to know its own URL
- The API needs to know the front-end's URL and vice versa

If custom domains are not possible for a test implementation,
you can remove the domain mappings and respective environment variables
for each Cloud Run service from the Terraform files,
deploy, and then create new Cloud Run revisions in the UI
with the environment variables manually populated with the
generated URLs.
